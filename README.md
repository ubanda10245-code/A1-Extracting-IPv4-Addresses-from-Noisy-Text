# IPv4 Address Extractor

Reads a line of text from the user and extracts the first valid IPv4 address
(with an optional port) found within it, ignoring surrounding letters,
symbols, and whitespace.

An address is valid if it has four dot-separated octets (0-255, no leading
zeros unless the value is exactly 0) and, if a colon and port are present,
the port must also be fully valid (0-65535, same leading-zero rule).

Restrictions: 
 * No string-to-number conversion functions: atoi, atol, atoll, strtol, strtoul, strtod, 
    stoi, stol, stoul, sscanf, scanf with numeric conversions.
 * No address-parsing library functions: inet_aton, inet_pton, inet_addr, or equivalents.
 * NO regular-expression facility (std::regex, POSIX regex.h, or similar).

Type `END` to quit the program.
